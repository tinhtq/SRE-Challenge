# Your Technical Interview

The technical part of your on-site interview at Jellyvision will consist of general technology-related questions, and questions directly related to your implementation of the take-home exercise:

* Project Review
* Project Extended Scenarios
* General Technical Discussion
* You Interview Us!

## Project Review

We will ask you to describe in detail how you implemented your project.  We may
ask you why you did something a certain way.  "I ran out of time" is a
perfectly good answer, but we'll expect you to be able to explain how you would
have something differently if you had more time.

## Project Extended Scenarios

We'll ask you how you would change your project given new requirements.  Questions like:
  * What would you do if the app had to handle X amount of traffic?
  * Would you change anything about the app if it had to handle sensitive
    personally identifiable information, like Social Security numbers?

## General Technical Discussion

We'll ask you questions related to your past experiences and general technical
knowledge.  These will be standard interview questions like:
  * Tell us about a project that you worked on that you are particularly proud
    of Tell us about a technical choice you made that, in retrospect, was the
  * wrong choice

## You Interview Us!

Ask us anything!  We're trying to figure out if you're a good fit for us, but we want you to feel confident that we are a good fit for you.

## Submission
To submit your take-home exercise, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub or GitLab.
2. Upload the contents of the zip file provided to your repository.
3. Make the necessary changes to the project in a new branch.
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub or a Merge Request (MR) on GitLab with your changes.
5. Ensure that the PR/MR clearly shows the differences between the original code and your changes.

This process will allow us to easily review your work and see the improvements or modifications you have made.
